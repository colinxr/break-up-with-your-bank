      '<p>Yes! Credit unions are regulated and insured in the same way as banks. The difference is that banks are federally insured, while the majority of credit unions are provincially insured. This actually works in your favour, because the federal government only insures your account to a limit of $100k, whereas provincial limits are $250k. This means that your credit union account is insured to a higher amount than your bank account! Look for your provinces deposit insurance or guarantee (DICO in Ontario) for more information.</p>',

    title: 'Can I expect the same services at a credit union?',
    description:
      '<p>Credit unions offer nearly identical services as banks. You’ll often experience more personalized customer service, shorter wait times on the phone, and less employee turnover, meaning that the person you’re talking to is likely to have more knowledge and experience than a teller at the bank!',

    title: 'What about my mortgage/debt/lines of credit?',
    description:
      '<p>While it’s certainly possible to switch your mortgages, loans and investments to a credit union, you don’t have to take these steps in order to make an impact! The money in your chequing and savings accounts are what the bank uses to fund their unsavory investments. They cannot leverage your debt in the same way. We suggest switching your chequing and savings accounts to a credit union, and keeping your mortgages, loans, lines of credit, etc. where they are. We encourage you to shop around for a credit card that best suits your needs- that may mean continuing to use a bank-associated card, or signing up with an independent one. You will still be able to make all of your regular payments through your credit union account.',

    description:
      '<p>Yes! Most credit unions are part of a large national network that allows users to access ATMs surcharge-free nationwide. Visit <a href="https://dingfree.ca">dingfree.ca</a> or <a href="https://exchangenetwork.ca">exchangenetwork.ca</a> to find a connected ATM near you!</p>',
