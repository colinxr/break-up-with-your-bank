The *Break Up With Your Bank* campaign was initially launched by a small group of members of *Toronto [World Beyond War](https://worldbeyondwar.org/),* a global anti-war organization working to end the military industrial complex. We are now a small collective of passionate activists working together from the East and West coasts of so-called Canada. We stand in solidarity with the BDS movement, and with Indigenous land defenders from Turtle Island to Palestine- and across the globe.
